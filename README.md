# cs2-cfg-ext
This tool will extend the base cfg file syntax to simplify complex commands.

Example:
Have a rotating alias. (Cycle)
`A -> B -> C -> D -> A`

We can reuse this to create simple toggles.
`A -> B -> A`

Future:
We could imagine creating functions and a more complex syntax with conditions.
I'm not sure how far Counter-Strike 2's console will allow us to extend it's config language.
I will try to setup some tests with the cs's executable.
